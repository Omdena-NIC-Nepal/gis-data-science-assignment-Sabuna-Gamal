## Assignment: GIS Data Science for Climate in Nepal
### Objective:
- The objective of this assignment is to assess your understanding and practical skills in GIS Data Science, specifically focusing on climate data analysis for Nepal. You will be required to perform data reading, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks using Python.

#### Environment Setup

To set up the environment and run the Python scripts:

1. Install the required libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Ensure the dataset files are placed in the appropriate directories as specified in the code.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

#### Data Sources and Preprocessing

- **Data Sources**:

  - The data source used for this assignment was provided by our instructor. Link: https://github.com/Desmondonam/Nepal_Climate_change

- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - The shapefile was reprojected to EPSG:4326 for consistency.
  - Raster data was read and stored along with its bounding box for visualization.


#### Visualizations and Their Significance

1. **Heatmaps**:
   - The heatmap visualization for trend in climate vulnerability indices from 2020 to 2050 across Nepalâ€™s provinces.
2. **Boxplot**:
   - The box plot for climate vulnerability index of 2050 compared to 2020.
3.**Precipitation Maps**:
   - Visualized precipitation data for 2020 and 2050 overlaid on Nepal's map.
   - Significance: Highlights spatial distribution and changes in precipitation over time.
   -mean, maximum and minimum precipitation
4. **Temperature Maps**:
   - Bisualized temperature data for 2020 and 2050 overlaid on Nepal's map.
   - Significance: Highlights spatial distribution and changes in temperature over time
   - mean, maximum and minimum temperature
